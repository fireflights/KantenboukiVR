See what weather experts see when they read the sky (Kantenbouki) using Virtual Reality

Kantenbouki VR attempts to address the issues of availability of weather condition examples, experts, and tools. 
Starting from a captured 360Â° image of the weather condition outside, the system provides Kantenbouki experts 
with an authoring tool to annotate different elements that they can see from the image. 

Consequently, novices who wish to learn Kantenbouki can use the expert-annotated VR environment as a training tool.


This system is developed in Unity 2018.1.1f1 on Windows 10, built for the HTC Vive. 
Thus, SteamVR should be installed while using the application.
As much as possible, building and deploying the application should be relatively straightforward.
